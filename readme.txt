**How this could help you?**



*   Every-time you save a new post or pages, WordPress creates a revision of that post or page. If you edit a post 6 times you might have 5 copy of that post as revisions. Imagine if your post or pages are long and big. It is a huge number of bytes that's on your MySQL overhead. Now WP-Optimize allows you to optimize and shrink your posts table by removing not necessary post revisions from the database. As example, if you have a post which is approximately 100KB data and you have 5 revisions of that post, the total space wasted is about 500KB. And if you have 100 posts similar to it, you have 50MB database space wasted.

*   Similar to the scenario described above, there might be thousands of spam and un-approved comments in your comments table, WP-Optimize can clean and remove those in a single click

*   WP-Optimize reports which database tables have overhead and wasted spaces also it allows you to shrink and get rid of those wasted spaces

*   Automatically cleans database every week and respects the "Keep X number of weeks data" option.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==



= Can you help me restore my database? =



No I can't. Please make a backup of your entire database before using this Plugin for the first time. Also backup your database when you upgrade to a MAJOR NEW version (for example - v0.9.8 to 1.5.5 ).



= Everytime I clear transient options, it comes back automatically =



WordPress automatically creates transient options. It is pretty difficult to completley get rid of it. This is why everytime you clean transient options, you will notice new transient options has been created. My best advice would be clear the transient options on a schedule. So, for example it may create 50 transient option in a week and you clear it weekly so the next 50 transient option comes in. Rather than having 100 transient option, you will have 50 per week.



= Optimization does not have any effect on database / it is not optimizing the database =



Some of the shared web hosting company does not allow scripts to run OPTIMIZE command via SQL statements. If you are hosted with these web hosts, the optimize action will not be able to optimize your database. Please consult your web hosting company regarding this matter.



= I am having error - Warning: mysql_num_rows(): supplied argument is not a valid MySQL result resource ...  =



*   Upgrade/Update your WordPress to at least 3.5

*   Upgrade/Update your WP-Optimize plugin

*   Upgrade your PHP to at least 5.1.xx

*   Upgrade your MySql to at least MySql 5.1.xx

*   Remember: PHP 4.xx and MySql 4.xx not supported



= Is there any bug in this plugin =



This is a very primary version of the plugin. So I would recommend you to test it out on your local system or make a backup of your database (just to be extra careful).
