== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is there any bug in this plugin =

This is a very primary version of the plugin. So I would recommend you to test it out on your local system.

= Wordpress logged me out when I rename my username =

Because you've changed your username, wordpress can't get authentication data from the database. Use your new username and the password you've used before
