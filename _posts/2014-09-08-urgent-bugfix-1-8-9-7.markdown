Just after releasing the previous update with new changes; I have noticed that the **Disable/Enable trackback/comments buttons** on the setting screen causing the **AUTO SCHEDULE** option to reset itself. 

In fact, executing any of the **Disable/Enable trackback/comments buttons** will disable the **AUTO SCHEDULE** option, ==you will still be able to enable it by clicking the checkbox==.

*I've made the _necessary changes_ and re-organize the Settings Screen so this does not happen again. Refer to the new screen above.*

##How does the new screen work?
1. If you want to disable or enable trackbacks and comments, select the dropdown list for each of them. 
2. Press **SAVE SETTINGS**, it will enable or disable the corresponding feature such as Trackbacks and Comments.
3. **This only reflects the ==published posts==**, the reason of doing that is - ==Drafts or unpublished post you may choose to enable comments or trackbacks, it is up to you.==
