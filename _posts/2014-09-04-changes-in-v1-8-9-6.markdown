###What's changed
![Image]({{ site.url }}/images/enable-disable-trackbacks.png)

1. There were few **number formatting problem** and detection of InnoDB table format. Charles Dee Rice solved the problems that I missed out. Thank you!
2. Now has the ability to batch **enable/disable trackbacks and comments** for ***all your published posts***. Please remember this is a batch operation. If there is a post that was disabled but the rest of the other posts were enabled, the batch operation will reset it. 
3. Other code optimizations and cleanup
